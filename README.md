# Bad Debt/Credit Machine Learning Model - Binary Classification (CAPSTONE PROJECT)
This capstone project is a final work/project from Junior Data Science program (intermediate course) in an online summer class with RMDS Narasio Data (https://www.instagram.com/narasiodata/). In this work I have multiple objectives to be achieved:

**1. Perform Bad Debt / Credit Analysis**

First, I was asked to analyze the dataset from a 'bank' to get insights from debtors debt/credit history. Then, I was asked to do an assessment of the data & determine which debtors have good credit scores and which debtors have bad credit scores, based on the credit history of the debtors.

**2. Build Machine Learning Model (Binary Classification)**

Then, the bank asked me to create an automatic creditworthiness assessment system, based on the credit history data of their debtors. In this work, I was asked to create a machine learning model using the binary classification method. The machine learning model created based on this method will later produce a bad credit scoring prediction based on automatic classification of the data performed by the machine learning model.

**3. Predict New Data**

After the machine learning model is successfully created, this machine learning model will be applied to the new data & will generate a bad credit score based on the binary classification method in the machine learning model.

**4. Give Feedback Recommendation**

Lastly, I was asked to provide feedback in the form of conclusions & recommendations on the results of the machine learning model that have been made, and business decisions that the bank can make or implement in the future.
